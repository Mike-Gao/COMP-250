<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p>
This course is an introduction to several core topics in computer
science, namely data structures and algorithms, and object oriented
design.  For the data structures and algorithms component, you will
learn about various types of lists (arrays, linked lists, stacks,
queues), trees, and graphs.  You will also learn some basic algorithms
that use these data structures, for example, to do searching and
sorting, and how to analyze such algorithms in terms of the amount of
computation that is required to carry them out.  These analysis tools
will be used heavily in subsequent data structures and algorithms
courses (COMP 251, 360) and are a central part of computer science.

A second significant part of the course is a deeper appreciation of
object oriented design from what you had in COMP 202.  You will learn
how classes can be organized into hierarchies, and how variables and
methods defined in the classes of the hierarchy are related to each
other.  These relationships, known as inheritance and polymorphism,
will developed more fully in subsequent courses that follow the
software stream of the CS curriculum. 

<h2> Prerequisites </h2>

The prerequisite for this course is <i> COMP 202 Introduction to
  Computing 1 </i> or any one semester course on programming in a high
level language such as C or Java.  Because the majority of students in
  COMP 250 have taken COMP 202 (or equivalent), most students will
  know the basics of Java already.  As such, I will not be reviewing
  basic Java. <br><br>

If you have not taken COMP 202 (or an equivalent Java course), then
you should see a recent 
<a href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs202">
COMP 202 </a> Course Outline to make sure you have the appropriate
background for COMP 250.  At a bare minimum, you should have
experience with programming in a high level language and you should
have written several programs that use variables, expressions,
conditional statements (if-then-else, switch), loops (while, for),
arrays, pointers (references in Java), basic I/O (keyboard inputs or
reading from a file, writing to console or to a file).  

<br><br> COMP 202 uses Java which is an object oriented language, and
so students who have taken 202 will also be familiar with basic
concepts in object oriented programming (OOP).  Those of you who have
only programmed in C (but not C++) will be unfamiliar with the basic
concepts of OOP such as objects and classes.  This applies, in
particular, to some Fac. Eng. students who have taken COMP 208.  If
you want to take COMP 250, <i> you will need to do some work in the
first few weeks of the semester to catch up. </i> In particular, I
strongly suggest that you sign out from the library or buy a basic
book on Java programming and read the parts of it that are covered in
COMP 202 and work through some of the programming examples.  Two very
good introductory texts for Java are:
 <ul> 
<li> D. Liang, ``Introduction to Java Programming,'' Brief Edition, Prentice Hall.
<li> Lewis and Loftus, ``Java software solutions,''    Addison-Wesley.
</ul>
There is also plenty of good material online, for example,
<ul>
<li> a book  
<a href="http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/java/english/dist_v4.0/thinkapjava.pdf">
``How    to think like a computer scientist'' </a>.  The current
 (Aug. 2012) version of that book covers  roughly  the same material
 as COMP 202. 
 <li>Java <a href="http://java.sun.com/">website</a>
&nbsp;+&nbsp;<a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">tutorials</a>
+ API (<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api"> SE 6) </a>
        </li>
</ul>
I have prepared a <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/250/Reading-BackgroundJava.pdf">document</a>
 with Java terms that you should be familiar
with, <i> after reviewing basic Java </i>.   Once you are familiar
 with most of the terms in that document and have written some basic
 Java programs yourself, you will be ready for COMP 250.

<h2> Lecture Notes </h2>

There is no required textbook for the course.  Instead, a complete set
of lecture notes will be made available on the <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~langer/250.html"> public course web
  page </a>, as will
the lecture slides, and links to other material including Exercises.   
The specific topics and lecture schedule can be found on the public course
    web page. 

<h2> Discussion Board </h2>

There will be a course discussion board which is organized into
various topics such as lectures and assignments.  Please use this
discussion board to clarify any problems you may have.  The instructor
would very much appreciate it if you would help each other by
answering questions on the discussion boards.  In the same vein,
please do not email the instructor or T.A.s with technical questions
about the course material.  By posting questions and answers on the
discussion, everyone can benefit.     

Please note that the instructor may remove postings on the discussion
if they are redundant or unhelpful.  If you have made a posting and
you wish it to be removed, simply make a request to the instructor and
it will be done.


<h2> Evaluation </h2>

Your final grade will be calculated using the following percentage breakdown.

<ul>
<li> Four Assignments (40 % total)
<ul>
<li> A1 to be posted in mid-September
<li>
A2 to be posted in early October
<li>
A3 to be posted in late October
<li>
A4 to be posted in mid-November
</ul>
You will be given at least 10 days to complete each assignment.  
<br><br><li>

 Two in-class Quizzes  (20 % = 2 x 10 %)}
<ul>
<li> Quiz 1 in early October
<li> Quiz 2 in early November
</ul>
<br>
<li> Final Exam (40 % or 60 %) held during Final Examination Period.  
</ul>
<b>If your percentage grade on the Final Exam is greater than your
percentage grade on the two Quizzes, then your Final Exam grade
will count for 60 % of your final grade and the two Quizzes will count
    for 0%.  </b>
This policy is intended to allow some flexibility, for example, if you
are unable to attend one of the quizzes because you are sick or you
have some other obligation. <br><br>
<b> Note that while there is some flexibility in the exams, there is no
  flexibility with the assignments.  If you don't do
    an assignment, then you get 0.    </b>

<i>
In accord with McGill University's Charter of Students' Rights,
students in this course have the right to submit in English or in
French any written work that is to be graded. </i>


<h2> Policy on collaboration </h2>

We greatly encourage you to discuss the assignment problems with each
other.  However, this discussion must not go so far that you are
revealing the solutions to each other.  And it certainly should not go
so far that you are sharing code.  We realize there is sometimes a
fine line between giving hints and revealing solutions, so we ask you
try to follow a simple guideline: for any discussion you have about an
assignment, you should be comfortable if anyone else <i> including the
instructor </i> were listening in. 

<h2> McGill policy on academic integrity </h2>

<i> McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all
  students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating,
  plagiarism and other academic offenses under the Code of Student
  Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures. See <a
  href="http://www.mcgill.ca/students/srr/honest/"> this link </a> for more 
  information. </i>
